### Generative Casual Inference: Potential Empirical Projects

#### Generative Causal Inference of Pandemic Effects: A Simulation Study of School Reopening Strategies

##### **Research Question**: How did school reopening policies during a pandemic affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease spread and student learning outcomes?

##### **Context**: This question is highly relevant, socially important, and complex, with numerous interacting factors and competing hypotheses.

##### Why this is a good fit for GCI:

* **Multiple Competing Hypotheses**:  
    - H1: School closures are the primary driver of reduced learning gains.  
    - H2: Community transmission rates are the dominant factor, with school policies having a minor impact.  
    - H3: Certain reopening policies (e.g., hybrid models) have heterogeneous effects depending on student demographics and access to home resources.  

* **Strong Theoretical Foundation**:  
    Epidemiological models provide a basis for simulating disease spread.  
    Educational theories offer insights into how different learning modalities affect student outcomes.  
    Sociological perspectives can inform models of social mixing and inequality.  
    
* **Spatial Aspect**: Disease spread is inherently spatial, influenced by contact patterns within schools and communities. Reopening policies also vary spatially.  

* **Multiple Patterns and Datasets**:  
    - Disease spread patterns (incidence rates, hotspots) from public health data.  
    - Student learning outcomes (test scores, attendance, dropout rates) from educational datasets.  
    - Data on social contact patterns and demographics.  

* **Potential GCI Approach**:
    1. Build multiple ABMs:
        * One model focuses on in-school transmission, varying reopening policies.
        * Another model emphasizes community transmission and its spillover effects on schools.  
        * A third model incorporates heterogeneous student learning, resources, and policy effects.  
    2. Calibrate the ABMs:  
        * Use epidemiological data to calibrate disease transmission parameters.
        * Use educational data to calibrate student learning rates under different modalities.  
        * Incorporate data on household demographics and community structure.  
    3. Generate synthetic data: Run simulations under various policy scenarios.  
    4.  Compare synthetic data with real-world patterns:  
        * Match simulated disease spread to observed incidence rates.  
        * Compare simulated learning outcomes to changes in test scores or attendance.  
        * Examine spatial correlations of disease and learning disparities.  
    5. Refine models and test further: Iterate the process to identify the most plausible explanations.  

This potential project allows for a rigorous comparison of how different mechanisms and assumptions play out, while also providing policy-relevant insights.   

#### School Choice and Access to Resources: A Generative Causal Analysis

##### **Research Question**: What are the long-term effects of different school choice policies on student sorting, school diversity, and educational equity?  

1. **Context**: School choice is a complex and highly debated policy issue with significant equity implications.  
    * Competing Hypotheses:  
        - H1: Choice increases sorting by income and race, exacerbating inequity.  
        - H2: Choice leads to school specialization and improved outcomes for all.  
        - H3: The effects of choice depend heavily on the regulatory context and information available to parents.   
    * **Theoretical Foundation**:  
        - Economic theories of choice and competition.  
        - Sociological theories of segregation and inequality.  
        -  Educational theories of school effectiveness and peer effects.  
    * **Spatial Aspect**: School locations and student residential patterns create a spatial dimension to choice.  
    * **Multiple Patterns and Datasets**:  
        - Student enrollment data by school and demographics.  
        - School performance data and resource allocation.  
        - esidential segregation data.
        - Data on student transportation patterns.
