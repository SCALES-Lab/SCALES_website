## Potential SCALES Projects

### Generative Casual Inference: Potential Empirical Examples

1. Research Question: How do different social media recommendation algorithms affect the spread of misinformation and polarization within online communities?

    Context: This is a highly relevant and complex issue with societal implications.
    Competing Hypotheses:
        H1: Algorithms prioritizing engagement (clicks, shares) exacerbate misinformation spread.
        H2: Algorithms prioritizing homophily (connecting similar users) increase polarization.
        H3: Algorithmic transparency has a mitigating effect on both.
    Theoretical Foundation:
        Social network theory for modeling information diffusion.
        Communication theory for modeling persuasion and belief formation.
        Psychology of online behavior for modeling user engagement.
    Spatial Aspect: Network structure and user interactions create a virtual "space" where information spreads.
    Multiple Patterns and Datasets:
        Misinformation spread patterns from social media data.
        Polarization measures (attitude divergence) from surveys or user behavior data.
        Network structure data (who follows whom) from platform APIs.

2. Research Question: What are the long-term effects of different school choice policies on student sorting, school diversity, and educational equity?

    Context: School choice is a complex and highly debated policy issue with significant equity implications.
    Competing Hypotheses:
        H1: Choice increases sorting by income and race, exacerbating inequity.
        H2: Choice leads to school specialization and improved outcomes for all.
        H3: The effects of choice depend heavily on the regulatory context and information available to parents.
    Theoretical Foundation:
        Economic theories of choice and competition.
        Sociological theories of segregation and inequality.
        Educational theories of school effectiveness and peer effects.
    Spatial Aspect: School locations and student residential patterns create a spatial dimension to choice.
    Multiple Patterns and Datasets:
        Student enrollment data by school and demographics.
        School performance data and resource allocation.
        Residential segregation data.
        Data on student transportation patterns.
