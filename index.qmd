## Study of Cognition and Learning in Educational Systems

The SCALES Lab investigates how educational outcomes emerge from the complex interplay of cognitive, social, institutional, and environmental forces. We approach education not as a collection of isolated interventions or outcomes, but as a dynamic system shaped by feedback loops, structural conditions, and resource distribution.

Our research focuses on understanding these systems through rigorous, theory-driven modeling — integrating insights from cognitive science, ecology, data science, and education policy. Rather than centering normative agendas, we aim to develop tools and evidence that clarify how learning environments function and how access to educational resources can be broadened across diverse contexts.

## Who We Are

The SCALES Lab brings together researchers, graduate students, and collaborators who are interested in causal modeling, simulation, and data-driven inquiry. We welcome interdisciplinary thinkers committed to building better theories and uncovering the mechanisms behind patterns in educational development and achievement.

## What We Do

•	Construct ecological models of learning, development, and achievement  
•	Use agent-based modeling and AI tools to simulate and test educational systems  
•	Apply Bayesian and mixed-effects methods to analyze large-scale education datasets  
•	Develop methods for causal inference and theory-building without relying solely on experimental designs  
•	Train students in computational tools and applied policy research  

## Join the Lab

The SCALES Lab is always looking for curious, motivated graduate students and collaborators interested in systems-level research in education. Whether you’re trained in education, data science, cognitive science, policy, or a related field, we welcome those who want to explore how educational outcomes emerge from complex systems — not just how to improve isolated metrics.

We are especially interested in students who want to:  
•	Use computational tools (e.g., R, Python, NetLogo) to model educational systems  
•	Develop or test theory-driven models of achievement, development, or engagement   
•	Work with large-scale datasets (e.g., ECLS-K, state longitudinal data systems)  
•	Learn about causal inference, Bayesian methods, and agent-based simulation  
•	Contribute to research that helps understand and improve access to educational resources  

We are not organized around a specific ideological lens or framework. Instead, we prioritize intellectual rigor, methodological innovation, and a clear commitment to understanding how education works in real-world contexts.
