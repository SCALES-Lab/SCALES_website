    "text": "Dr. Murrah is a researcher and professor in the field of education, with a focus on modeling the complex systems that shape learning and academic outcomes. His work integrates tools from cognitive science, ecology, machine learning, and causal inference to better understand how structural factors and resource access interact over time.\nRather than advancing normative frameworks or ideological agendas, his research is grounded in the belief that scientific progress in education comes from building strong, testable theories that reflect the dynamic, real-world contexts in which learning occurs. He is particularly interested in using ecological and agent-based models to simulate educational environments and to explore how interventions or policy shifts might alter system-level behavior.\nDr. Murrah works closely with graduate students and collaborators on projects that span data science, policy modeling, and applied theory development, all with the goal of broadening access to resources and opportunities through empirically grounded insights.",

    "text": "Study of Cognition and Learning in Educational Systems\nThe SCALES Lab investigates how educational outcomes emerge from the complex interplay of cognitive, social, institutional, and environmental forces. We approach education not as a collection of isolated interventions or outcomes, but as a dynamic system shaped by feedback loops, structural conditions, and resource distribution.\nOur research focuses on understanding these systems through rigorous, theory-driven modeling — integrating insights from cognitive science, ecology, data science, and education policy. Rather than centering normative agendas, we aim to develop tools and evidence that clarify how learning environments function and how access to educational resources can be broadened across diverse contexts.",
