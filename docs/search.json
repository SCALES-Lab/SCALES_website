    "text": "Dr. Murrah is a researcher and professor in the field of education, with a focus on modeling the complex systems that shape learning and academic outcomes. His work integrates tools from cognitive science, ecology, machine learning, and causal inference to better understand how structural factors and resource access interact over time.\nRather than advancing normative frameworks or ideological agendas, his research is grounded in the belief that scientific progress in education comes from building strong, testable theories that reflect the dynamic, real-world contexts in which learning occurs. He is particularly interested in using ecological and agent-based models to simulate educational environments and to explore how interventions or policy shifts might alter system-level behavior.\nDr. Murrah works closely with graduate students and collaborators on projects that span data science, policy modeling, and applied theory development, all with the goal of broadening access to resources and opportunities through empirically grounded insights.",

    "text": "Study of Cognition and Learning in Educational Systems\nThe SCALES Lab investigates how educational outcomes emerge from the complex interplay of cognitive, social, institutional, and environmental forces. We approach education not as a collection of isolated interventions or outcomes, but as a dynamic system shaped by feedback loops, structural conditions, and resource distribution.\nOur research focuses on understanding these systems through rigorous, theory-driven modeling — integrating insights from cognitive science, ecology, data science, and education policy. Rather than centering normative agendas, we aim to develop tools and evidence that clarify how learning environments function and how access to educational resources can be broadened across diverse contexts.",

    "text": "Join the Lab\nThe SCALES Lab is always looking for curious, motivated graduate students and collaborators interested in systems-level research in education. Whether you’re trained in education, data science, cognitive science, policy, or a related field, we welcome those who want to explore how educational outcomes emerge from complex systems — not just how to improve isolated metrics.\nWe are especially interested in students who want to:\n• Use computational tools (e.g., R, Python, NetLogo) to model educational systems\n• Develop or test theory-driven models of achievement, development, or engagement\n• Work with large-scale datasets (e.g., ECLS-K, state longitudinal data systems)\n• Learn about causal inference, Bayesian methods, and agent-based simulation\n• Contribute to research that helps understand and improve access to educational resources\nWe are not organized around a specific ideological lens or framework. Instead, we prioritize intellectual rigor, methodological innovation, and a clear commitment to understanding how education works in real-world contexts.\nInterested in joining? Reach out via the [Contact] page or email Dr. Murrah directly with your CV and a short note about your research interests.",
