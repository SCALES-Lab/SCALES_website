We approach education not as a collection of isolated interventions or outcomes, but as a dynamic system shaped by feedback loops, structural conditions, and resource distribution.\nOur research focuses on understanding these systems through rigorous, theory-driven modeling — integrating insights from cognitive science, ecology, data science, and education policy. Rather than centering normative agendas, we aim to develop tools and evidence that clarify how learning environments function and how access to educational resources can be broadened across diverse contexts.",

Whether you’re trained in education, data science, cognitive science, policy, or a related field, we welcome those who want to explore how educational outcomes emerge from complex systems — not just how to improve isolated metrics.\nWe are especially interested in students who want to:\n• Use computational tools (e.g., R, Python, NetLogo) to model educational systems\n• Develop or test theory-driven models of achievement, development, or engagement\n• Work with large-scale datasets (e.g., ECLS-K, state longitudinal data systems)\n• Learn about causal inference, Bayesian methods, and agent-based simulation\n• Contribute to research that helps understand and improve access to educational resources\nWe are not organized around a specific ideological lens or framework. Instead, we prioritize intellectual rigor, methodological innovation, and a clear commitment to understanding how education works in real-world contexts.\nInterested in joining?

    "text": "Generative Causal Inference\n\nGenerative Causal Inference: Unifying Generative Social Science and Strong Inference\nGenerative Causal Inference (GCI) is a cutting-edge research framework developed in the SCALES Lab that unites agent-based modeling with formal causal inference to better understand the complex mechanisms behind educational and health outcomes. By simulating how individual behaviors and social interactions give rise to large-scale patterns—like achievement gaps, student dropout, or teacher turnover—GCI allows us to explore not only what causes these outcomes, but how and why. Drawing on the rigor of causal graphs and structural models alongside the explanatory power of computational simulations, GCI provides a powerful tool for testing theories, evaluating policies, and generating new insights that would be difficult to uncover through traditional methods alone. Graduate students working on GCI projects will gain hands-on experience with simulation, statistical modeling, and causal reasoning—preparing them to tackle some of the most pressing and complex problems in education and social science research.\n\n\nGenerative Causal Inference as a Tool for Explainable AI and Scientific Advancement\nThis project explores Generative Causal Inference (GCI), an innovative framework combining computational simulations and causal reasoning to create transparent, trustworthy, and scientifically rigorous AI systems. Rather than relying solely on opaque machine learning algorithms, GCI leverages agent-based modeling and reinforcement learning to simulate and uncover the causal processes behind complex social phenomena, such as educational achievement gaps and health outcomes. By integrating causal inference methods (such as DAGs and structural causal models) with pattern-oriented modeling and strong inference, GCI not only provides robust explanations for AI predictions but also enhances scientific theory-building and hypothesis generation. Graduate students in the SCALES Lab will have the unique opportunity to develop skills in cutting-edge computational modeling, causal analysis, and interdisciplinary research, positioning themselves to significantly influence both the development of explainable AI systems and theoretical advancements in education and health sciences.\n\n\nEcological Modeling for Education Research: A New Framework for Systems Thinking and Causal Inference\nEcological Modeling in Education Research reframes how we study and improve education systems by treating them as complex, adaptive systems influenced by dynamic interactions across students, teachers, families, institutions, and policies. This project blends systems thinking, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence—including agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning- with, and causal inference via Generative Causal Inference to develop rich, theory-driven simulations of real-world educational challenges. Students working on this project will help build computational models that simulate educational processes such as achievement gaps, policy interventions, and learning dynamics over time. This work aims not only to explain how educational outcomes emerge, but also to design and test interventions in silico, offering a new pathway for rigorous, actionable research. Graduate students with interests in computational modeling, educational disparities, cognitive science, or data-driven policy design are especially encouraged to join."

His work integrates tools from cognitive science, ecology, machine learning, and causal inference to better understand how structural factors and resource access interact over time.\nRather than advancing normative frameworks or ideological agendas, his research is grounded in the belief that scientific progress in education comes from building strong, testable theories that reflect the dynamic, real-world contexts in which learning occurs. He is particularly interested in using ecological and agent-based models to simulate educational environments and to explore how interventions or policy shifts might alter system-level behavior.\nDr. Murrah works closely with graduate students and collaborators on projects that span data science, policy modeling, and applied theory development, all with the goal of broadening access to resources and opportunities through empirically grounded insights.",
